### Home

Thank you for visiting my web site. These pages contain general information about [my research](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research) and related interests in geomorphology and ecogeomorphology. I study physical aspects of rivers and streams as well as feedbacks with the biota that occupy and alter them (i.e. ecogeomorphology). My [research](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/research), [teaching ](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/students-teaching)and [service ](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/service)are focused on understanding basic curiosities about the dynamics of fluvial systems as well as a strong commitment to making science relevant to better manage, conserve and restore watersheds and their ecosystems.

Note that if you are a repeat visitor, many of the resources I used to host on my personal page here I have migrated over to our lab pages at [http://etal.joewheaton.org](http://etal.joewheaton.org/). 

Enjoy, 

Joe
