### Workshop Websites

As part of my teaching and service commitments, I regularly organize, deliver and contribute to 'Espresso Courses' and workshops. For most of these, we build websites to serve as hubs of information primarily for the participants, but also for folks interested in the topics and unable to attend, as well as other instructors looking to 'borrow' materials. Below is a list of our workshops:
