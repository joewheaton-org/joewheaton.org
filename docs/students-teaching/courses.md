### Teaching - Courses & Workshops

This page contains a list of current and past courses I have taught. The current courses also have links to course pages as appropriate.

When ever I go to the effort of putting together a course or workshop, I try to post everything on the web so participants/students can refer back to it and so other instructors can borrow content for their own courses.
