### Ground Control Targets

You can purchase ground control targets from many survey supplies (e.g. [Iron Cross Aerial Targets](http://www.stakemill.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=382_248&zenid=41148185e48529660a352b2dc7bf075f) for $15 to ​$45 a piece).

Alternatively, you can go cheap and make your own. For our Aerial Photography Targets we use a rubber pond liner material material called [EPDM Pond Liner](http://www.pondliner.com/category/Firestone_EPDM_Pond_Liners_10), which you can cut down to size. It can be purchased at Home Depot or Lowes in the Gardening. It is a on a roll and can be purchased by the linear foot. It expands to 15 foot width. It is cut it into one meter squares and then painted using a rubberized white paint. 

We typically cut ours into 1 m x 1 m sqaures or 0.5 m x 0.5 m squares (depending on flight height) and then label them with numbers that can be seen from sky.
