### Graduate Students

## Prospective Graduate Students

If you are interested in potentially working with me at [Utah State University](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnr.usu.edu%2Fwats%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfYa_A51bJoDBh-uTkiV70HG0CanQ), [contact me](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joewheaton.org.uk%2FContact.asp&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzdD1RUKiUtkWR9UMnxL40saYahvpQ) early in the process to discuss ideas. I've prepared a [prospective student page](http://www.joewheaton.org/Home/students-teaching/graduate-students/information-for-prospective-graduate-students) which elaborates the application process, funding opportunities and what its like to live in Logan.
